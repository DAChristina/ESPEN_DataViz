This repository contains the ESPEN data used for the analysis of LF in Burkina Faso. The data is consisting of two files: (1) site-level and (2) implementation units (IU). The visualisation and some analysis was done in ESPEN_DataViz.R.
There is an additional spatial (polygonal) data for Burkina Faso, accessed from GADM database, though some regional names and borders might have changed.
